            Mass spectrometry data is one of the key sources of information in many workflows in medicine and across the life sciences. Mass fragmentation spectra are generally considered to be characteristic signatures of the chemical compound they originate from, yet the chemical structure itself usually cannot be easily deduced from the spectrum. Often, spectral similarity measures are used as a proxy for structural similarity but this approach is strongly limited by a generally poor correlation between both metrics. Here, we propose MS2DeepScore: a novel Siamese neural network to predict the structural similarity between two chemical structures solely based on their MS/MS fragmentation spectra. Using a cleaned dataset of {\textgreater} 100,000 mass spectra of about 15,000 unique known compounds, we trained MS2DeepScore to predict structural similarity scores for spectrum pairs with high accuracy. In addition, sampling different model varieties through Monte-Carlo Dropout is used to further improve the predictions and assess the model’s prediction uncertainty. On 3600 spectra of 500 unseen compounds, MS2DeepScore is able to identify highly-reliable structural matches and to predict Tanimoto scores for pairs of molecules based on their fragment spectra with a root mean squared error of about 0.15. Furthermore, the prediction uncertainty estimate can be used to select a subset of predictions with a root mean squared error of about 0.1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MS2DeepScore outperforms classical spectral similarity measures in retrieving chemically related compound pairs from large mass spectral datasets, thereby illustrating its potential for spectral library matching. Finally, MS2DeepScore can also be used to create chemically meaningful mass spectral embeddings that could be used to cluster large numbers of spectra. Added to the recently introduced unsupervised Spec2Vec metric, we believe that machine learning-supported mass spectral similarity measures have great potential for a range of metabolomics data processing pipelines.},

            The proliferation of new psychoactive substances (NPS) has necessitated the development and improvement of current practices for the detection and identification of known NPS and newly emerging derivatives. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is quickly becoming the industry standard for these analyses due to its ability to be operated in data-independent acquisition (DIA) modes, allowing for the collection of large amounts of data and enabling retrospective data interrogation as new information becomes available. The increasing popularity of HRMS has also prompted the exploration of new ways to screen for NPS, including broad-spectrum wastewater analysis to identify usage trends in the community and metabolomic-based approaches to examine the effects of drugs of abuse on endogenous compounds. In this paper, the novel applications of HRMS techniques to the analysis of NPS is reviewed. In particular, the development of innovative data analysis and interpretation approaches is discussed, including the application of machine learning and molecular networking to toxicological analyses.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are steadily emerging on the drug market. To remain competitive in clinical or forensic toxicology, new screening strategies including high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) are required. Machine learning algorithms can detect and learn chemical signatures in complex datasets and use them as a proxy to predict new samples. We propose a new screening tool based on a SC-specific change of the metabolome and a machine learning algorithm.
            
            
              Methods
              Authentic human urine samples (n = 474), positive or negative for SCs, were used. These samples were measured with an untargeted metabolomics liquid chromatography (LC)–quadrupole time-of-flight-HRMS method. Progenesis QI software was used to preprocess the raw data. Following feature engineering, a random forest (RF) model was optimized in R using a 10-fold cross-validation method and a training set (n = 369). The performance of the model was assessed with a test (n = 50) and a verification (n = 55) set.
            
            
              Results
              During RF optimization, 49 features, 200 trees, and 7 variables at each branching node were determined as most predictive. The optimized model accuracy, clinical sensitivity, clinical specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 88.1\%, 83.0\%, 92.7\%, 91.3\%, and 85.6\%, respectively. The test set was predicted with an accuracy of 88.0\%, and the verification set provided evidence that the model was able to detect cannabinoid-specific changes in the metabolome.
            
            
              Conclusions
              An RF approach combined with metabolomics enables a novel screening strategy for responding effectively to the challenge of new SCs. Biomarkers identified by this approach may also be integrated in routine screening methods.},

Some aspects of waterborne diseases and the urgent need for improved sanitation in developing countries are also discussed. The review addresses current scientific advances to cope with the great diversity of pollutants. It is organized along the different temporal and spatial scales of global water pollution. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have affected water systems on a global scale for more than five decades; during that time geogenic pollutants, mining operations, and hazardous waste sites have been the most relevant sources of long-term regional and local water pollution. Agricultural chemicals and waste-water sources exert shorter-term effects on regional to local scales.},

            There is growing interest in the possible health threat posed by endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which are substances in our environment, food, and consumer products that interfere with hormone biosynthesis, metabolism, or action resulting in a deviation from normal homeostatic control or reproduction. In this first Scientific Statement of The Endocrine Society, we present the evidence that endocrine disruptors have effects on male and female reproduction, breast development and cancer, prostate cancer, neuroendocrinology, thyroid, metabolism and obesity, and cardiovascular endocrinology. Results from animal models, human clinical observations, and epidemiological studies converge to implicate EDCs as a significant concern to public health. The mechanisms of EDCs involve divergent pathways including (but not limited to) estrogenic, antiandrogenic, thyroid, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, retinoid, and actions through other nuclear receptors; steroidogenic enzymes; neurotransmitter receptors and systems; and many other pathways that are highly conserved in wildlife and humans, and which can be modeled in laboratory in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, EDCs represent a broad class of molecules such as organochlorinated pesticides and industrial chemicals, plastics and plasticizers, fuels, and many other chemicals that are present in the environment or are in widespread use. We make a number of recommendations to increase understanding of effects of EDCs, including enhancing increased basic and clinical research, invoking the precautionary principle, and advocating involvement of individual and scientific society stakeholders in communicating and implementing changes in public policy and awareness.},

Although weaknesses in the relationship between spectral similarity scores and the true structural similarities have been described, little development of alternative scores has been undertaken. Here, we introduce Spec2Vec, a novel spectral similarity score inspired by a natural language processing algorithm—Word2Vec. Spec2Vec learns fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data to derive abstract spectral embeddings that can be used to assess spectral similarities. Using data derived from GNPS MS/MS libraries including spectra for nearly 13,000 unique molecules, we show how Spec2Vec scores correlate better with structural similarity than cosine-based scores. We demonstrate the advantages of Spec2Vec in library matching and molecular networking. Spec2Vec is computationally more scalable allowing structural analogue searches in large databases within seconds.},

            Prediction of chemical bioactivity and physical properties has been one of the most important applications of statistical and more recently, machine learning and artificial intelligence methods in chemical sciences. This field of research, broadly known as quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR) modeling, has developed many important algorithms and has found a broad range of applications in physical organic and medicinal chemistry in the past 55+ years. This Perspective summarizes recent technological advances in QSAR modeling but it also highlights the applicability of algorithms, modeling methods, and validation practices developed in QSAR to a wide range of research areas outside of traditional QSAR boundaries including synthesis planning, nanotechnology, materials science, biomaterials, and clinical informatics. As modern research methods generate rapidly increasing amounts of data, the knowledge of robust data-driven modelling methods professed within the QSAR field can become essential for scientists working both within and outside of chemical research. We hope that this contribution highlighting the generalizable components of QSAR modeling will serve to address this challenge.},

              Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually rely on tandem MS (MS/MS) to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of metabolites remain unknown. Recently, several computational approaches were presented for searching molecular structure databases using MS/MS data. Here, we present CSI:FingerID, which combines fragmentation tree computation and machine learning. An in-depth evaluation on two large-scale datasets shows that our method can find 150\% more correct identifications than the second-best search method. In comparison with the two runner-up methods, CSI:FingerID reaches 5.4-fold more unique identifications. We also present evaluations indicating that the performance of our method will further improve when more training data become available. CSI:FingerID is publicly available at

            Metabolites provide a direct functional signature of cellular state. Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually rely on tandem MS to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of metabolites remain unknown. We present a method for searching molecular structure databases using tandem MS data of small molecules. Our method computes a fragmentation tree that best explains the fragmentation spectrum of an unknown molecule. We use the fragmentation tree to predict the molecular structure fingerprint of the unknown compound using machine learning. This fingerprint is then used to search a molecular structure database such as PubChem. Our method is shown to improve on the competing methods for computational metabolite identification by a considerable margin.},

              Background
              Cheminformaticians are equipped with a very rich toolbox when carrying out molecular similarity calculations. A large number of molecular representations exist, and there are several methods (similarity and distance metrics) to quantify the similarity of molecular representations. In this work, eight well-known similarity/distance metrics are compared on a large dataset of molecular fingerprints with sum of ranking differences (SRD) and ANOVA analysis. The effects of molecular size, selection methods and data pretreatment methods on the outcome of the comparison are also assessed.
            
            
              Results
              
                A supplier database (
                https://mcule.com/
                ) was used as the source of compounds for the similarity calculations in this study. A large number of datasets, each consisting of one hundred compounds, were compiled, molecular fingerprints were generated and similarity values between a randomly chosen reference compound and the rest were calculated for each dataset. Similarity metrics were compared based on their ranking of the compounds within one experiment (one dataset) using sum of ranking differences (SRD), while the results of the entire set of experiments were summarized on box and whisker plots. Finally, the effects of various factors (data pretreatment, molecule size, selection method) were evaluated with analysis of variance (ANOVA).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                This study complements previous efforts to examine and rank various metrics for molecular similarity calculations. Here, however, an entirely general approach was taken to neglect any
                a priori
                knowledge on the compounds involved, as well as any bias introduced by examining only one or a few specific scenarios. The Tanimoto index, Dice index, Cosine coefficient and Soergel distance were identified to be the best (and in some sense equivalent) metrics for similarity calculations,
                i.e
                . these metrics could produce the rankings closest to the composite (average) ranking of the eight metrics. The similarity metrics derived from Euclidean and Manhattan distances are not recommended on their own, although their variability and diversity from other similarity metrics might be advantageous in certain cases (
                e.g.
                for data fusion). Conclusions are also drawn regarding the effects of molecule size, selection method and data pretreatment on the ranking behavior of the studied metrics.},

          Spectrum alignment of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data using the modified cosine similarity and subsequent visualization as molecular networks have been demonstrated to be a useful strategy to discover analogs of molecules from untargeted MS/MS-based metabolomics experiments. Recently, a neutral loss matching approach has been introduced as an alternative to MS/MS-based molecular networking, with an implied performance advantage in finding analogs that cannot be discovered using existing MS/MS spectrum alignment strategies. To comprehensively evaluate the scoring properties of neutral loss matching, the cosine similarity, and the modified cosine similarity, similarity measures of 955,228 peptide MS/MS spectrum pairs and 10 million small molecule MS/MS spectrum pairs were compared. This comparative analysis revealed that the modified cosine similarity outperformed neutral loss matching and the cosine similarity in all cases. The data further indicated that the performance of MS/MS spectrum alignment depends on the location and type of the modification, as well as the chemical compound class of fragmented molecules.},

	abstract = {Both targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches are used to understand the metabolic processes taking place in various organisms, from prokaryotes, plants, fungi to animals and humans. Untargeted approaches allow to detect as many metabolites as possible at once, identify unexpected metabolic changes, and characterize novel metabolites in biological samples. However, the identification of metabolites and the biological interpretation of such large and complex datasets remain challenging. One approach to address these challenges is considering that metabolites are connected through informative relationships. Such relationships can be formalized as networks, where the nodes correspond to the metabolites or features (when there is no or only partial identification), and edges connect nodes if the corresponding metabolites are related. Several networks can be built from a single dataset (or a list of metabolites), where each network represents different relationships, such as statistical (correlated metabolites), biochemical (known or putative substrates and products of reactions), or chemical (structural similarities, ontological relations). Once these networks are built, they can subsequently be mined using algorithms from network (or graph) theory to gain insights into metabolism. For instance, we can connect metabolites based on prior knowledge on enzymatic reactions, then provide suggestions for potential metabolite identifications, or detect clusters of co-regulated metabolites. In this review, we first aim at settling a nomenclature and formalism to avoid confusion when referring to different networks used in the field of metabolomics. Then, we present the state of the art of network-based methods for mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data analysis, as well as future developments expected in this area. We cover the use of networks applications using biochemical reactions, mass spectrometry features, chemical structural similarities, and correlations between metabolites. We also describe the application of knowledge networks such as metabolic reaction networks. Finally, we discuss the possibility of combining different networks to analyze and interpret them simultaneously.},

            The proliferation of new psychoactive substances (NPS) has necessitated the development and improvement of current practices for the detection and identification of known NPS and newly emerging derivatives. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is quickly becoming the industry standard for these analyses due to its ability to be operated in data-independent acquisition (DIA) modes, allowing for the collection of large amounts of data and enabling retrospective data interrogation as new information becomes available. The increasing popularity of HRMS has also prompted the exploration of new ways to screen for NPS, including broad-spectrum wastewater analysis to identify usage trends in the community and metabolomic-based approaches to examine the effects of drugs of abuse on endogenous compounds. In this paper, the novel applications of HRMS techniques to the analysis of NPS is reviewed. In particular, the development of innovative data analysis and interpretation approaches is discussed, including the application of machine learning and molecular networking to toxicological analyses.},

          Computational methods that aim to exploit publicly available mass spectrometry repositories primarily rely on unsupervised clustering of spectra. Here, we propose to train a deep neural network in a supervised fashion based on previous assignments of peptides to spectra. The network, called “GLEAMS,” learns to embed spectra into a low-dimensional space in which spectra generated by the same peptide are close to one another. We use GLEAMS as the basis for a large-scale spectrum clustering, detecting groups of unidentified, proximal spectra representing the same peptide, and we show how to use these clusters to explore the dark proteome of repeatedly observed yet consistently unidentified mass spectra. We provide a software implementation of our approach, along with a tool to quickly embed additional spectra using a pre-trained model, to facilitate large-scale analyses.},

After endocytosis the toxin is transported to the Golgi apparatus by a process that differs from the Rab9-dependent transport of mannose-6-phosphate receptors. Retrograde toxin transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) seems to be a requirement for subsequent toxin translocation to the cytosol where the toxin inhibits protein synthesis enzymatically. By using ricin we have characterized different types of endocytosis and the transport steps used by this toxin.}

Larger datasets of biological and toxicological properties of hundreds and thousands of substances are becoming available, enabling big data approaches in read-across studies. In the context of developing Good Read-Across Practice guidance, a number of case studies using various big data sources were evaluated to assess the contribution of biological data to enriching read-across. An example is given for the US EPA’s ToxCast dataset which allows read-across for high quality uterotrophic assays for estrogenic endocrine disruption. Similarly, an example is given for REACH registration data that enhances read-across for acute toxicity studies.

abstract="The performance of similarity measures for search, indexing, and data mining applications tends to degrade rapidly as the dimensionality of the data increases. The effects of the so-called `curse of dimensionality' have been studied by researchers for data sets generated according to a single data distribution. In this paper, we study the effects of this phenomenon on different similarity measures for multiply-distributed data. In particular, we assess the performance of shared-neighbor similarity measures, which are secondary similarity measures based on the rankings of data objects induced by some primary distance measure. We find that rank-based similarity measures can result in more stable performance than their associated primary distance measures.",

ABSTRACT={The Tox21 Data Challenge has been the largest effort of the scientific community to compare computational methods for toxicity prediction. This challenge comprised 12,000 environmental chemicals and drugs which were measured for 12 different toxic effects by specifically designed assays. We participated in this challenge to assess the performance of Deep Learning in computational toxicity prediction. Deep Learning has already revolutionized image processing, speech recognition, and language understanding but has not yet been applied to computational toxicity. Deep Learning is founded on novel algorithms and architectures for artificial neural networks together with the recent availability of very fast computers and massive datasets. It discovers multiple levels of distributed representations of the input, with higher levels representing more abstract concepts. We hypothesized that the construction of a hierarchy of chemical features gives Deep Learning the edge over other toxicity prediction methods. Furthermore, Deep Learning naturally enables multi-task learning, that is, learning of all toxic effects in one neural network and thereby learning of highly informative chemical features. In order to utilize Deep Learning for toxicity prediction, we have developed the DeepTox pipeline. First, DeepTox normalizes the chemical representations of the compounds. Then it computes a large number of chemical descriptors that are used as input to machine learning methods. In its next step, DeepTox trains models, evaluates them, and combines the best of them to ensembles. Finally, DeepTox predicts the toxicity of new compounds. In the Tox21 Data Challenge, DeepTox had the highest performance of all computational methods winning the grand challenge, the nuclear receptor panel, the stress response panel, and six single assays (teams “Bioinf@JKU”). We found that Deep Learning excelled in toxicity prediction and outperformed many other computational approaches like naive Bayes, support vector machines, and random forests.}

abstract = {Chemicals have improved our quality of life, but the resulting environmental pollution has the potential to cause detrimental effects on humans and the environment. People and biota are chronically exposed to thousands of chemicals from various environmental sources through multiple pathways. Environmental chemists and toxicologists have moved beyond detecting and quantifying single chemicals to characterizing complex mixtures of chemicals in indoor and outdoor environments and biological matrices. We highlight analytical and bioanalytical approaches to isolating, characterizing, and tracking groups of chemicals of concern in complex matrices. Techniques that combine chemical analysis and bioassays have the potential to facilitate the identification of mixtures of chemicals that pose a combined risk.}}
